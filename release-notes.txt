  the plugin on Java 11 runtime.

- Now plugin issues (issues created by installed Sonargraph plugins) are supported, they are
  activated (or deactivated) with the single rule 'Sonargraph Integration: Plugin Issue'.

  'Sonargraph Integration: Script Issue' is activated).

    the SonarQube server. The properties file is stored at '.sonargraphintegration/metrics.properties'.

          necessary to restart the SonarQube server because of a modified metrics.properties file.
